# API Key
You'll get it if deemed necessary for development ðŸ¤·

### What to do with API Key
1. Create a file in the root repo folder called *config.js*
2. Structure *config.js* like shown below
```javascript
var config = {
  API_KEY : [API KEY GOES HERE IN SINGLE QUOTES]
}

module.exports = config;
```
3. Add the following to *api.js*
```javascript
const config = require('./config.js');
const PROPUBLICA_API_KEY = config.API_KEY;
```
4. Make sure you have the .gitignore

If you expose the API key, you'll be banned from contributing to the project
